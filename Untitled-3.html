            Many luxury liners have golf courses. Unfortunately, quite often the balls fly out of the ship. In order to protect the environment, <br>a German company has developed fish food balls that do not cause the slightest harm to the waters of the world's oceans.

            <h1 class="name_2">Golfe Course </h1>
                 <p>UThe golf course consists of a series of holes, each of which has its own starting ground (Eng. Teeing ground). The starting area is marked with two marks showing the permissible boundaries of the zone where a ball peg (eng. Tee) can be installed. Also part of the site are a smooth field and an uneven field (Fairway and rough (English)) and other obstacles (English Hazard (golf)). The final part of the site is a hole, which, for the possibility of orientation, is marked in some way (usually with a flag). The hole is located on a special lawn "green" (Putting green (English)), where the height of the grass is minimal. In other places, the height of the grass may be very different in order to make it difficult to pass the site.

            <h1 class="name_2">Mini Golf </h1>
                 <p>Miniature golf or minigolf is a game that has been developed since the middle of the 19th century. A mini-golf course is a green on which the path of the ball to the hole is hampered by numerous obstacles in the form of stones, sand traps, artificial labyrinths, and so on. The player's task, as in regular golf, is to get the ball into the hole in the minimum number of strokes. The game is played only with a putter stick, swing is prohibited by the rules..
