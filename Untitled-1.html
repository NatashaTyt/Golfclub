        <p class="text_name">Let's dispel the myth a little that, once you get to a golf club, you immediately go to play on an 18-hole course. If you do not have a Green Card - a document that allows you to play on any golf course, you will only have a practice area at your disposal. By the way, you can get a Green Card by passing a theoretical and practical exam after training with our trainer.</p>
        <p class="text_name">What does the training area include? Driving range, a special area for practicing long shots, and putting-green, a short grass area with several holes carved into it. This is where you will spend time on your first lesson.</p>
        <p class="text_name">On the first visit, as well as on several subsequent visits, we recommend taking a lesson with a golf club coach. The lesson includes all the necessary equipment (sticks and balls) and lasts 50 minutes. You can not only learn about the technique of hitting and practice, but also get acquainted with the history of golf, etiquette and rules of the game. After the lesson, you can optionally try to work out the blows yourself.</p>

                <p>It is believed that the game of golf originated in Scotland and was invented by shepherds who, with the help of staves (future clubs), drove stones into rabbit holes. Presumably, the game existed already in the 14th century, and in the 15th century several laws were passed in Scotland prohibiting the game of "gof".
